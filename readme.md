Message from a father 

Project Name: A  message from father

Project Description: Interactive comic strip website.

Process: 

For the comic strip assignment my group and I started with the idea of doing something bittersweet that has a twist to it and turns into a comedy. We were going through the ideation and decided to theme the comic as a father massaging his long lost son. 

We started brainstorming different ideas and began scripting our storyline.  After coming up with a story which sounds convincing and reel we focused on building up the suspense as the story goes on since the comic it's essentially a scam to the main character.

Once we had a basic idea of our storyline we moved to sketching out the comic strips physically on paper and figuring out the design and layout along with the floor of the comic.

After this game the hard part, creating SVGs for the comic as this step of the process was time-consuming and tiring. We began by creating the landing page image which was the room itself. While two members of our team were figuring out the zoom and scroll effects the other two took up the role of doing the illustration. 

Once all the panels were created we all came together to combine our works, decide the placing of different pictures, the effects we could use to enhance the work and see our efforts on the site.



Reflection/Evaluation: 
We started our brainstorming journey with a bittersweet story. We wanted a letter to open and talk about a love story, but eventually realized that our idea was not interesting rough to catch the attention of the listener. 
We then thought about different things to do, until we came up with the idea of an interesting event over text message. Maybe tell a story over text as an incident between two friends? Of course, if the internet was involved there had to be a talk about cyber crime :) So eventually, we wrote a script about how a man gets scammed over the internet. 


It is interesting how we started with an idea of a letter and ended up with text messages. We were very unclear with the idea of a letter but overcame that with an idea of everyone’s interest in our team. 
Overall, our expectations were met to quite an extent. We wanted to work out on a story where we could use the irony of a medium of conversation , such as a letter or the internet in a comic way, and we believe we achieved that. The goal of our project was to make a relatable and enthralling website experience for the user to have a good time, and we believe we have achieved that goal. 
Challenges

The biggest challenge we faced other than the CSS positioning was to get the JavaScript and scrolling to work at the right place and come out the way we envisioned it.  
Another major challenge we faced when making the SVGs in adobe illustrator, was to use the right color combination to give it a monochromatic effect just to show that the person was walking in the dark. Also the part where we had to use different filters and gradients to get every element of the picture into different frames and keeping in mind all the right dimensions that we are using. 

Another difficulty we faced was when using SVGs we struggled to navigate through the code. In order to fix this we decided to shift back to using JPEG's as not only will they make the code more readable but also allow the positioning to be more easily modified.
